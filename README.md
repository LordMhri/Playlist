# Playlist App
## Overview
The Playlist App is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) 
that allows users to create, read, update, and delete songs in a playlist. 
The application also utilizes **`styled-components`** for styling, and  **`redux`** 
with **`redux-saga`** for state management.


## Features
* **Create**: Add new songs to your playlist.
* **Read**: View a list of all songs in the playlist.
* **Update**: Edit details of existing songs.
* **Delete**: Remove songs from the playlist.

  
## Technologies Used
* **MongoDb** : NOSQL database to store song data.
* **Express** : Web application framework for Node.js to handle API routes.
* **React**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment to run the server-side code.
* **Vite** : Build tool for the React frontend.
* **Styled-Components**: Library for styling React components using tagged template literals.
* **Redux**: State management library for managing the appâ€™s global state.
* **Redux-Saga** : Middleware for managing side effects in Redux, such as API calls.
